# Abstract

The market for higher education institutions in the UAE is fearce. Due to to the recent pandemic of COVID-19, many institutions are expected to partly open their educational programs online, which expected to result in overcrowding the market with educational programs supply. 
In this project we will discuss several tools to support university decisions on actions required to be taken amid the aftermath of the pandemic.  
This project aims to discover the current landscape of Higher Ed in Dubai and analyze several forecast models to support decision making processes in the universities. 
The project includes analysis on three groups of collected data: from government entity (KHDA census), Google Reviews and Google Trends. The first dataset analysis will include Linear Model, Quantile Regression Model, Random Forest Model. The second dataset will include Factorization Model and Sentiment Analysis. The last dataset will include time-series analysis and trend prediction with Holt-Winters. 
The datasets were divided into train and test sets as per the requirement for this project. 
This report consists of the following parts:
The overview section describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed; Methods section explains the process and techniques used, including data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, insights gained, and modeling approach for each of the performed analysis, followed by the Results section, subsequent to each analysis, that presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance for the Linear Model and Factorization Model; Finally, the Conclusion section provides a summary of the report, the limitations and future research.
Key findings:
There are 10 key findings on the future of higher education in Dubai, outlined in the [colclusion] part of the PDF report (PredictiveModel.pdf).
